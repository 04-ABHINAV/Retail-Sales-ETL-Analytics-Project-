# Retail-Sales-ETL-Analytics-Project-
Built an end-to-end ETL and analytics pipeline on 50K+ retail sales records using Python and SQL Server to deliver business insights on top products, regional sales, and growth trends.


This project demonstrates an end-to-end ETL and analytics workflow for retail sales data. Using Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy) and SQL Server, over 50,000 retail order records from Kaggle were ingested, cleaned, transformed, and stored for structured analysis.

The pipeline includes:

Data Cleaning & Transformation – Handling null values, formatting dates, and standardizing column names.

Feature Engineering – Creating new metrics such as profit and other derived KPIs.

Data Loading – Storing cleaned data in SQL Server for efficient querying.

Analytics & Insights – SQL queries to uncover business insights:

Top revenue-generating products and best-sellers by region

Month-over-month sales growth (2022 vs 2023)

Best-performing months per category

Highest growth sub-categories year-over-year

This project highlights how raw data can be transformed into actionable insights, bridging both technical ETL processes and business-focused analysis.
